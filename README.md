This repository serves as my **personal learning portfolio** — a collection of projects that document my progress in:

- **Python programming** (from basics to more advanced concepts)
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Data cleaning & processing**
- **Machine Learning** fundamentals
- **Neural networks** (future projects)
- Using **VS Code** as my main development environment

Every project represents a step forward — from simple console games to real machine learning applications.

## Current Projects

| #  | Project Name              | Description                                      | Key Topics / Skills Demonstrated                  | Status     |
|----|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 1  | [Rock Paper Scissors](1st%20Project-%20RPS/)     | Classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game                 | Basic Python, conditionals, loops, user input     | Completed  |
| 2  | [Washing up](2nd%20Project%20-%20Washing%20up/)  | (automation/script)                              | Functions, logic, possibly file handling / OOP    | Completed  |
| 3  | [Iris Classification](3rd%20Project%20-%20Iris/) | Classic ML beginner project – classifying iris flowers | Data loading, cleaning, scikit-learn, classification models | Completed  |
| 4  | [Snake Game](4th%20Project%20-%20Snake/)         | Classic Snake game (most likely using Pygame)    | OOP, event handling, game loops, graphics         | Completed  |

> More projects coming soon — including deeper machine learning, neural networks (TensorFlow/PyTorch), data pipelines, computer vision, NLP, and more!

## Learning Progression

```text
Beginner ───────► Intermediate ───────► Advanced
   └─ Console games     └─ First ML model     └─ Neural nets / Deep Learning
         └─ OOP & structure          └─ Data preprocessing & visualization

Feel free to explore the folders in any order — but they are roughly arranged from earliest to most recent projects.
